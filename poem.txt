The rainbow and the boy

Red

Green 
Indigo

These are the colours in the rainbow God created 
I love the story of joseph rainbow coat 
Rainbows are so beautiful to see 

Lets talk more about the boy who was hated for his rainbow coat, what a unique story

The well is where the story went south, joseph brothers due to their hate, threw joseph in a well 
They tried to kill him and was later sold into slavery
